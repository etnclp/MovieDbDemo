# MovieDbDemo

## Requirements

* Swift 5
* Xcode 12+

## Installation
Clone the repository and run.

## Project Structure

I prefer to use MVP-R in this project. I prefer to switch to VIPER by using interactor when it is much more complexed, but it was not necessary in this project. You can check out my projects I have done with other architectures on my github repository.

## Things I think are missing
- Couldn't pay much attention to UI.
- Too many missing comment out.
- Test cases. (I could only write API tests because time was short.)
